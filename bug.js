The following code snippet demonstrates an uncommon Firebase error related to improper data handling within a transaction:

```javascript
firebase.firestore().runTransaction(async (transaction) => {
  const docRef = firebase.firestore().collection('counters').doc('myCounter');
  const doc = await transaction.get(docRef);

  if (!doc.exists) {
    // This is where a common error occurs! The code assumes that the 
    // document will be created if it doesn't exist, but it's not automatically created within the transaction.
    transaction.set(docRef, { count: 1 }); 
  } else {
    const newCount = doc.data().count + 1;
    transaction.update(docRef, { count: newCount });
  }
});
```

The issue is that `transaction.set()` inside the `if (!doc.exists)` block might still fail if other clients are concurrently writing to the same document within a transaction.  It does *not* automatically create the document.
